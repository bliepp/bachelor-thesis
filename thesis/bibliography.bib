  abstract  = {The production of metal parts via laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing is growing exponentially. However, the transition of this technology from production of prototypes to production of critical parts is hindered by a lack of confidence in the quality of the part. Confidence can be established via a fundamental understanding of the physics of the process. It is generally accepted that this understanding will be increasingly achieved through modeling and simulation. However, there are significant physics, computational, and materials challenges stemming from the broad range of length and time scales and temperature ranges associated with the process. In this paper, we review the current state of the art and describe the challenges that need to be met to achieve the desired fundamental understanding of the physics of the process.},

  abstract   = {This study demonstrates the significant effect of the recoil pressure and Marangoni convection in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of 316L stainless steel. A three-dimensional high fidelity powder-scale model reveals how the strong dynamical melt flow generates pore defects, material spattering (sparking), and denudation zones. The melt track is divided into three sections: a topological depression, a transition and a tail region, each being the location of specific physical effects. The inclusion of laser ray-tracing energy deposition in the powder-scale model improves over traditional volumetric energy deposition. It enables partial particle melting, which impacts pore defects in the denudation zone. Different pore formation mechanisms are observed at the edge of a scan track, at the melt pool bottom (during collapse of the pool depression), and at the end of the melt track (during laser power ramp down). Remedies to these undesirable pores are discussed. The results are validated against the experiments and the sensitivity to laser absorptivity is discussed.},

  abstract   = {In this paper, an integrated computational materials science approach for selective laser melting (SLM) at the mesoscale is presented. A particle dropping model was developed to simulate the representative powder-bed particle distribution of a measured titanium alloy powder. Thermal fluid flow and resulting microstructural evolution of a set of laser scanned single tracks with different powder layer thicknesses and scanning speeds during SLM were also studied using both computational and experimental approaches. The simulated powder particle distribution was found to be consistent with experimental measurement. The thermal fluid flow model predicts that single laser scanned tracks become increasingly irregular-shaped with increased powder layer thickness and increased laser scanning speed. These findings were reinforced by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The more dispersed dissipation of the localised heat for thicker powder layers is understood to cause increased melting and evaporation. This can lead to increased Marangoni force and recoil pressure which in turn destabilises the melt flow. The use of an argon atmosphere speeds up the solidification process when compared with air but does not affect the morphology of single tracks significantly. The predicted microstructure was consistent with the electron backscattered diffraction data. The microstructure-based modelling methodology considering the representative powder size distribution provides a good predictive capability for the laser-powder interaction behaviour, surface structure and porosity development.},
