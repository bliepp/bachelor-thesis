  abstract  = {The production of metal parts via laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing is growing exponentially. However, the transition of this technology from production of prototypes to production of critical parts is hindered by a lack of confidence in the quality of the part. Confidence can be established via a fundamental understanding of the physics of the process. It is generally accepted that this understanding will be increasingly achieved through modeling and simulation. However, there are significant physics, computational, and materials challenges stemming from the broad range of length and time scales and temperature ranges associated with the process. In this paper, we review the current state of the art and describe the challenges that need to be met to achieve the desired fundamental understanding of the physics of the process.},

A three-dimensional high fidelity powder-scale model reveals how the strong dynamical melt flow generates pore defects, material spattering (sparking), and denudation zones. The melt track is divided into three sections: a topological depression, a transition and a tail region, each being the location of specific physical effects. The inclusion of laser ray-tracing energy deposition in the powder-scale model improves over traditional volumetric energy deposition. It enables partial particle melting, which impacts pore defects in the denudation zone. Different pore formation mechanisms are observed at the edge of a scan track, at the melt pool bottom (during collapse of the pool depression), and at the end of the melt track (during laser power ramp down). Remedies to these undesirable pores are discussed. The results are validated against the experiments and the sensitivity to laser absorptivity is discussed.},

  abstract   = {In this paper, an integrated computational materials science approach for selective laser melting (SLM) at the mesoscale is presented. A particle dropping model was developed to simulate the representative powder-bed particle distribution of a measured titanium alloy powder. Thermal fluid flow and resulting microstructural evolution of a set of laser scanned single tracks with different powder layer thicknesses and scanning speeds during SLM were also studied using both computational and experimental approaches. The simulated powder particle distribution was found to be consistent with experimental measurement. The thermal fluid flow model predicts that single laser scanned tracks become increasingly irregular-shaped with increased powder layer thickness and increased laser scanning speed. These findings were reinforced by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The more dispersed dissipation of the localised heat for thicker powder layers is understood to cause increased melting and evaporation. This can lead to increased Marangoni force and recoil pressure which in turn destabilises the melt flow. The use of an argon atmosphere speeds up the solidification process when compared with air but does not affect the morphology of single tracks significantly. The predicted microstructure was consistent with the electron backscattered diffraction data. The microstructure-based modelling methodology considering the representative powder size distribution provides a good predictive capability for the laser-powder interaction behaviour, surface structure and porosity development.},

The advances are in three key areas for massively parallel computation such as on BlueGene/L (BG/L): fault tolerance, application kernel optimization, and highly efficient parallel I/O. In particular, we have developed novel capabilities for handling hardware parity errors and improving the speed of interatomic force calculations, while achieving near optimal I/O speeds on BG/L, allowing us to achieve excellent scalability and improve overall application performance. As a result we have successfully conducted a 2-billion atom KH simulation amounting to 2.8 CPU-millennia of run time, including a single, continuous simulation run in excess of 1.5 CPU-millennia. We have also conducted 9-billion and 62.5-billion atom KH simulations. The current optimized ddcMD code is benchmarked at 115.1 TFlop/s in our scaling study and 103.9 TFlop/s in a sustained science run, with additional improvements ongoing. These improvements enabled us to run the first MD simulations of micron-scale systems developing the KH instability.},

The detailed characterizations for the parts produced by the SLM process are evaluated. An SLM scanning speed of 695, 775, or 853 mm/s was selected. The findings show that a high quality of surface morphology and microstructure is obtained at a scanning speed of 775 mm/s. In addition, the maximum surface roughness values for both upper and side surfaces are approximately 0.460 µm and 0.592 µm, respectively. Furthermore, surface defect characteristics regarding the speed mechanism parameter for the SLM system are also discussed, and the challenges to the part quality, and potential for numerous industries (e.g., aerospace, automotive, and biomedical), creating microstructures, are observed.},

It was found that the microstructure, roughness, densification and microhardness of Ti6Al4V parts were a strong function of processing parameters. An excellent Ti6Al4V part with the high microhardness and the smooth surface can be manufactured by selective laser melting using preferable laser power 110W and scanning speed 0.4m/s, corresponding to continuous melting mechanism.

The microstructure, phase structure and mechanical properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy/field-emission Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM/TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), tensile and fatigue tests. The results indicated that the SLM AlSi10Mg exhibited a supersaturated Si network structure precipitated along α-Al cell. Brittle β-Al5FeSi and π-Al8FeMg3Si6 phases were found in the as-cast and SLM AlSi10Mg respectively due to different thermal histories during processing. The SLM AlSi10Mg showed higher tensile strength but lower elongation than the casting, as the result of grain refinement and tortuous crack path. The fatigue results revealed that unmelted powder, oxide inclusion and pores can considerably degrade the fatigue properties for the SLM AlSi10Mg. The SLM process offered a new method for material processing that would avoid harmful Fe-bearing intermetallic compounds and refine the microstructures for enhancing strength.},

Selective laser melting (SLM), is a type of additive manufacturing that can produce metal parts directly and it has begun to be used in various industrial settings. However, the erosion properties of the SLM processed parts have only rarely been reported. The paper addresses the cavitation erosion behavior of AlSi10Mg samples fabricated by SLM at different laser scanning speeds. A wrought sample was also tested to provide a basis for comparison. Sample hardness and microstructure were investigated. Results showed the cavitation erosion behaviors of SLM samples to differ greatly from that of the wrought sample. The erosion rate of SLM samples was found to peak in the first 30s. This was accompanied by the removal of particles inside pores. After peaking, the erosion rate of the SLM samples decreased significantly. SLM samples showed an extremely low erosion rate entering the steady-state period. Large, deep craters which were common wear marks on the wrought sample, were not present on the SLM samples. Different scanning speeds resulted in different max erosion rates.},

A relatively large laser beam with a diameter of 200 μm is utilized to produce a stable melt pool at high layer thickness, and the appropriate scanning track, which has a smooth surface with a shallow contact angle, can be obtained at the scanning speeds from 40 mm/s to 80 mm/s. By adjusting the hatch spacings, the density of multi-layer samples can be up to 99.99\%, which is much higher than that achieved in previous studies about high layer thickness selective laser melting. Meanwhile, the building rate can be up to 7.2 mm3/s, which is about 2 times–9 times that of the commercial equipment. Besides, two kinds of defects are observed: the large un-melted defects and the small spherical micropores. The formation of the un-melted defects is mainly attributed to the inappropriate overlap rates and the unstable scanning tracks, which can be eliminated by adjusting the processing parameters. Nevertheless, the micropores cannot be completely eliminated. It is worth noting that the high layer thickness plays a key role on surface roughness rather than tensile properties during the SLM process. Although a sample with a relatively coarse surface is generated, the average values of yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation are 1050 MPa, 1140 MPa, and 7.03\%, respectively, which are not obviously different than those with the thin layer thickness used in previous research; this is due to the similar metallurgical bonding and microstructure.},
