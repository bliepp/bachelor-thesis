# Bachelor thesis (B.Sc. Physik)

## Folder structure
* imd: A submodule pointing to a forked version of IMD. The custom branch features the ability for SLM simulations
* imd\_cookie\_cutter: A submodule of my custom written IMD sample modifier
* thesis: The actual bachelor thesis written in LaTeX
* presentation: The corresponding presentation

## Dependencies
* LaTeX: On Linux I highly recommend a full texlive installation.
* JabRef: The bibliography is 100% managed by JabRef. Don't changes something by hand except you know exactly what you are doing!
* [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org): The text editor must accept file-based formatting via [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) (natively or by plugin).
* I highly recommend to use [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) (the Code-OSS version) with the [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) extension.
